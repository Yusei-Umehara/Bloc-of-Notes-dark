# DARK BLOCK OF NOTES

This is a copy of the Notepad windows app created on python tkinter with a default black/yellow theme plus another options of editing colors, fonts, etc.
downsides: you can't re-open a file with the same config and it's not as versatile as de notepad from windows that's on the path.
